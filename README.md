# ForumBot
ForumBot is one of the bots I made while learning Java. It was designed for [Discord](https://discord.com/) using the [JDA library](https://github.com/DV8FromTheWorld/JDA).

As I learned new things over time, I tried to improve it with new features.

## Detailed Explanation of Features

### Embed Pages

The bot can create pages with embeds that allow for easier navigation between multiple messages. This can be especially useful for long posts or for organizing multiple pieces of information into a single message.

### Custom Topic Images

The bot can use custom images to accompany forum topics, making it easier to differentiate between topics and adding some visual flair to the server.

### Settings Menu

The bot has a built-in settings menu that allows users to configure various aspects of the bot's behavior, such as the prefix used to invoke commands or the language used for responses.

### Database-Level System

The bot uses a database to track user levels and other data, allowing for more advanced features such as level-up rewards or unlocking new commands at certain levels.

### Reaction Commands

The bot can be configured to respond to specific reactions on messages, allowing for a more interactive experience for users.
